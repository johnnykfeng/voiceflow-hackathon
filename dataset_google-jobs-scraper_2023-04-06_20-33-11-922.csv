Here you’ll have the chance to create a meaningful difference to patients’ lives. With science at its heart, this is the place where breakthroughs born in the lab become transformative medicines – for the world’s most sophisticated diseases.

At AstraZeneca, we’re not afraid to do things differently. We’re building a new kind of organisation to reset expectations of what a bio-pharmaceutical company can be. This means we’re opening up new ways to work, pioneering ground breaking methods and bringing unexpected teams together.

Data Scientists in the Data Science & Advanced Analytics (DS&AA) team work directly with our partners in therapy areas to deliver insight from clinical trial data. Working with clinical, translational and biometrics teams, we use machine learning, predictive modelling... and visualisation to support delivery of our clinical trial pipeline across early and late phases of development, including:
• Study planning and development: using prognostic models to identify patients most likely to have an event / progress to inform inclusion and exclusion criteria for recruitment
• In-stream clinical studies: using exploratory data science to identify subgroups of patients
• Post-hoc meta-analysis: using legacy clinical trial data to inform clinical development strategies in existing or new indications
• Our projects have direct impact on the development pipeline and our insights makes valuable contributions to AstraZeneca. Through this we are able to have a direct impact on transforming patients’ lives by accelerating new medicines to those most in need.

As a, Associate Director Data Scientist within the team, your key responsibilities will be:
• Stakeholder engagement to understand challenges in clinical trial development and to facilitate technical discussions on methodologies to identify solutions.
• Lead and deliver data science and machine learning projects to address specific clinically driven questions.
• Communicate complex methodologies to a range of audiences including machine learning researchers, statisticians and clinical teams, either through project team meetings or seminars/training courses.
• Develop, test, implement and refine methods with a software engineering approach.
• Collaborate with a diverse range of customers, enabling effective consensus, conflict resolution and alignment to project goals.

Essential requirements
• PhD or equivalent and extensive relevant scientific experience in statistics, mathematics, computer science, the physical sciences or related subject.
• Significant experience of the pharmaceutical experience or relevant field.
• Proven track record of driving complex collaborations to successfully deliver impactful data science projects.
• Recognised expert in field including publication/conference accomplishments
• Experienced in Python.

Why we love it

If your passion is science and you want to join a team that makes a bigger impact on patients’ lives, then there’s no better place to be. Here we truly understand science and apply it every day to strengthen and grow our pipeline.

So, what’s next?
• Are you already envisioning yourself joining our team? Good, because we can’t wait to hear from you!

The CDPE is recruiting a highly motivated and skilled individual to join our research team as a Data Scientist in Biostatistics. The position is a full-time, 1-year temporary contract at St. Michael’s Hospital with the possibility of extension. The successful candidate will work on a portfolio of cutting-edge peer-reviewed funded projects within the scope of CDPE’s research program on substance use, overdose prevention, and novel treatment modalities. In collaboration with CDPE colleagues, the candidate will be expected to lead the... development and application of novel statistical methods for analysis of longitudinal cohort data, administrative health data, and population-level morbidity and mortality incidence data.
