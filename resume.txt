RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER CONSULTANT (CONTRACT), BRANCHY SOLUTION	DEC 2022- PRESENT
●	Led research on the latest ML tools for table extraction
●	Created ML product that detects and extracts table information from documents with transformer-based object detection (DETR) - https://johnnykfeng-table-extractor-app-table-extractor-app-gwkxr3.streamlit.app/
●	Help clients save thousands of hours in manual labor by automating table extraction
RESEARCH ASSISTANT, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO	   2015-2022
●	Processed and cleaned raw data from ultrafast electron diffraction experiments via SQL and Python
●	Found novel insights in data to convey the scientific findings of our experiment
●	Prepared detailed data visualizations with Python for publication in a scientific journal
●	Wrote a comprehensive report on my experiment, data processing steps, and analysis for publication
●	Presented my research to both public and technical audience on various occasions, e.g. global scientific conferences, local university committee of professors, public speaking competitions
●	Led a large-scale project involving multiple collaborators across the world (details written in my thesis)

RELEVANT DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

MODELING CHURN AND REVENUE FOR RIDE-HAILING SERVICE (REPORT)	
●	Built a Monte-Carlo simulation based on the statistical Poisson process to model the churn and revenue of a ride-hailing service. My simulations project the earnings and profit of the company for a 1-12 month period. I also proposed strategies for maximizing short and long-term profits based on this analysis.
TOXIC COMMENTS CLASSIFICATION NLP PROJECT (BLOG POST)	
●	Developed an ML model that implements text vectorization and multilabel classification pipeline to classify comments for toxicity. Improved precision and recall scores for very imbalance dataset. 
BITCOIN RISK ASSET ANALYSIS (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK)	
●	Detailed analysis of the performance of Bitcoin as an investment asset compared to Gold and the S&P 500. The analysis uses historical price data of each asset to characterize the volatility and ROI.
